### That all goes out the window.  In order to host both the 'book' website and the course materials, i had
to use Netlify, and stand up 2 websites.
1) the 'book', which is the homepage of the course is at https://datascienceandrhome.netlify.app/
2) the course materials site, which you can't navigate, but all the pages are there is at
  https://datascienceandr.netlify.app/
