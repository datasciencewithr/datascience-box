### The above all goes out the window.  In order to host both the 'book' website and the course materials, i had
to use Netlify, and stand up 2 websites.  Just followed the instructions on Netlify.
1) the 'book', which is the homepage of the course is at https://datascienceandrhome.netlify.app/ and it is a full fledged 'website', meaning that it has a landing page, and you can navigate to other pages.
2) the course materials site, which you can't navigate, but all the pages are there is at
  https://datascienceandr.netlify.app/  and this is not really a website, but a collection of pages, linked from other stuff.
e.g.
https://datascienceandr.netlify.app/course-materials/slides/u1-d01-welcome/u1-d01-welcome.html#1
https://datascienceandr.netlify.app/course-materials/application-exercises/ae-01a-un-votes/unvotes.html#1

But, there is still a build_pages GitHub action that was running and hosting - i disabled it.
there is an install failure for stringi in build_book

Plan:
Sessions are roughly 4 hour chunks, corresponding to 1 day workshop or 1 week of normal class.
