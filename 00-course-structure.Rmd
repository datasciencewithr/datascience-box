# Course structure {.unnumbered}

This course is broken into 'Sections'.
A Section is roughly 4 hours of combined lecture and labs, corresponding to 1 day of a workshop or 1 week of normal class.

In the Type column, you see different Types of material.

-   Lectures are just that, I talk and hopefully you don't fall asleep.
-   Application exercises are done in class, by everyone, and I'll help you if you get stuck, but you don't turn them in to be graded.
-   Labs are also exercises that are done in class, by everyone, but you will turn them in (I'll show you how) and I'll check them out to make sure you did it right.
-   Homework is that thing you do outside of class, by everyone, and you turn it in to be graded.
-   Project is discussion about or presentation of the big end-of-class project.

I encourage together-work, but don't just copy your friend, it does neither you nor them any good.
Plagiarism is frowned upon; don't do it.
