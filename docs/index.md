# Welcome {.unnumbered}

<img src="dsbox3.png" class="cover" width="240" height="240"/> Welcome to [YaRDS](https://datasciencewithr.github.io/datascience-box/index.html), Yet another R Data Science Course.
It is an introductory course in Data Science, taught using the R language and RStudio.
The core content of the course focuses on [data acquisition](https://wiki.atlan.com/data-acquisition/) and [data wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling), [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), [data visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization), and [effective communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication) of results.

## Who is this course for? {.unnumbered}

If you are a learner who is interested in making sense of (sometimes messy) data and who

-   has little to no background in data science, statistics, or programming, or
-   has been using R for a while but wants to modernize their skills,

the materials in this course are for you!
The content is definitely newcomer friendly, however you should be willing to ask questions and dive into the documentation of the packages we introduce.
The course is designed to be accessible to new learners at the undergraduate level and above, though adventurous learners at the high school level might also enjoy these materials.

## What tools will I use? {.unnumbered}

-   [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), which is a programming language. The name is derived from the S programming language, which was a statistical computing language created at Bell Labs during the golden age of computing (i.e. the 1970s). You can learn more about [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) if you can't sleep some night.
-   [RStudio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RStudio), which is a sweet GUI interface to R. You can do lots of cool things in RStudio. Check the link if counting sheep just isn't doing it for you.
-   [GitHub](https://github.com/), which is a website which hosts the git version control system. We will make use of these tools to distribute and collect homework and labs. Learn about the mascot for GitHub, the [Octocat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#Mascot).

Please see Getting started to learn about setting up for the course.
Don't worry if you don't get it done before we start - we will go over it in class.

## What can I do with R and its related tools and packages? {.unnumbered}

-   [Create awesome 'live' documents with R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). R Markdown documents let you tell a story with your data. This website and the course slides were made with R Markdown.
-   [Make Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). Shiny apps are little applications that help people understand the data you have prepared. It is an awesome communication tool.

## Inspiration {.unnumbered}

Below you will find some examples of Shiny Apps written in R.
This is just a sampling of what you can do with R and its related tools.
